## About Veenotes

Veenote is a learning platform designed to help users enhance their learning experience with online videos. 

It allows users to organize YouTube videos into collections, and bookmark specific timestamps within each video. Each bookmark can include a custom title and description, enabling users to highlight key moments and add personal notes for better retention and faster review.
